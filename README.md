## 📂 Projects Overview

### 📌 1. Iris Flower Classification
`iris-flower.ipynb`

A classic supervised machine learning project to classify iris flowers into three species: *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica*, based on petal and sepal dimensions.

#### ✅ Key Highlights:
- Dataset: [Iris Dataset (UCI)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabh00007/iriscsv)
- Algorithms used: K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree
- Visualized sepal and petal distributions using seaborn pairplots
- Evaluated accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

#### 📊 Skills Practiced:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation

### 📌 2. Car Price Prediction
`car-price.ipynb`

Built a regression model to predict the price of cars based on their brand, engine size, horsepower, mileage, and other features.

#### ✅ Key Highlights:
- Dataset: [Car Price Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijayaadithyanvg/car-price-predictionused-cars)
- Applied data cleaning and feature encoding (label & one-hot)
- Models used: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- Used RMSE and R² score to evaluate performance

#### 📊 Skills Practiced:
- Feature engineering
- Regression modeling
